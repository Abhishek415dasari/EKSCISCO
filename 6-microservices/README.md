# Microservices Deployment (Argo CD & Istio)

This folder contains manifests for three sample microservices, each including:
- Deployment
- Service
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
- Istio VirtualService for routing

Each subfolder represents a different microservice. These are GitOps-ready for use with Argo CD.
